Using Traversy Short Course

-HTML on itself is very ugly
-more of a skeleton

HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language and is not a Programming Language
-it has no logic , just structure and presentation
- building block of the web..All web rely on HTML
- not enough to secure a job with it

What you need
-Browser
-Text Editor 
irregardless of OS

use (VS Code) - personal preference

-Download and installation notes

Starting on HTML
-no special server and run it locally
-.html extension
-index.html (starting point of a site(root file))

HTML File Creation 
-index.html (open with VS Code)
-Type Hello World , save and run
-Should show text in Browser
Tags
-Basic building blocks
-Sorrounded by angle brackets
-Come in pairs (opening and close)
<br> self closing tag

structure

-Everything in HTML tag
    -head tag (external links etc)
         -no effect on the output.
         -title , meta-data , descriptions
    -body
        - actual content

    -Doctype declaration(shows type of HTML)

Use Ctrl + U to view source Code
is shows the generated HTML (from backend or static pages)

Use Dev Tools

<!-- for comments --!>

Headings - bigger bold text with some padding

P for paragraphs
 -paragraphs have margins (space at top and bottom)
 - displayed as block

Block-Level elements vs inline elements
 -for block you start on a new line  inline is otherwise
 -Block (p , div , head , body) they take full width , inline(a,img,span) only take required space

Inline - Work with text
 <strong> tag - usually bold.used to make text stand output
 <em> - usually italic
 <a> - soround object with an <a> tag to link(connect ) it elsewhere..Another page maybe
    -href is the location of the page you want to link to
     -target opens on a blank page

Tags and Attributes
Attributes 
    -provide information about a tag ie the href and the target
    -placed in the start tag
    -stores key value pairs
    -value is in quotes

list 
Two types - unordered and odered
    -unordered = <ul> tag
        -bulleted points
        usually used for navigation

    -odered = <ol> tag
        -numbered points
 use the tag to initialise the list and the <li> tag for each element

 Tables 
 <table> tag to create table 
    -<thead>  tag to create table heading
        <tr> tag to create table rows
            <th> tag to create table heading
    -<tbody>
        <tr>
            <td> tag to create table data

Do not use tables for layout
